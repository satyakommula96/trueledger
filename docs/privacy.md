# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** March 01, 2026

TrueLedger is designed with a **privacy-first, offline-only** architecture. Your financial data remains entirely on your device and under your control at all times. This policy explains how your information is handled locally and confirms that no data is collected, shared, or tracked by the application.

## 1. Data Collection and Use

TrueLedger functions as a local database for your financial life. All information you enter remains stored on your physical device.

### Data Stored Locally:
*   **Financial Data:** Income, expenses, budgets, subscriptions, loans, goals, assets, and related records.
*   **Intelligence & Insights:** Behavior patterns, wealth projections, and health scores are calculated entirely on your device using local algorithms.
*   **Preferences:** App settings, categories, and personalization data.

TrueLedger does **not** collect, transmit, or store any personal or financial data on external servers. We do not have access to your database, your logs, or your usage history.

## 2. No Data Sharing or Tracking

Our commitment to your privacy is absolute:
*   **No Third-Party Analytics:** We do not use analytics or telemetry services (such as Google Analytics or Firebase) to track how you use the app.
*   **No Data Selling:** Since we do not collect your data, we have nothing to sell or share with third parties, advertisers, or data brokers.
*   **No Cloud Sync:** By default, TrueLedger does not sync with any cloud services. Backup and data transfer are entirely manual processes controlled by the user.

## 3. Data Security

### Local Encryption
On supported platforms, local databases are encrypted using **SQLCipher (AES-256)**. Encryption keys are managed by the operating system’s secure key storage (such as Keychain on iOS/macOS or Keystore on Android).

### App Lock (PIN & Biometrics)
Users can optionally enable a local PIN or biometric authentication (Fingerprint, Face ID, etc.) to prevent unauthorized physical access to the app on their device.

## 4. Permissions

TrueLedger requests permissions only when required for user-initiated features:
*   **Notifications:** Used locally for bill reminders and alerts (optional).
*   **Storage / Files:** Only accessed when you explicitly choose to export a report or create a manual backup.
*   **Biometrics:** Optional device-level authentication for unlocking the app.

Permissions are never accessed in the background and no data from these permissions is uploaded.

## 5. Data Deletion

You are the sole owner of your data. You can delete all your records at any time:
1.  By using the "Reset All Data" option in the App Settings.
2.  By uninstalling the application, which removes all local app data from your device.

## 6. Desktop Platforms

On desktop platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), all data is stored locally in your user profile's application directory. This data is not shared between system users and is never transmitted externally.

## 7. Contact and Transparency

TrueLedger is an open-source application. Our code is transparent and available for audit by the community.
