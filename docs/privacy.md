# Privacy Policy

TrueCash is designed with a **privacy-first, offline-only** architecture. Your financial data remains entirely on your device and under your control at all times.

## 1. Data Collection and Use

TrueCash **does not collect, transmit, or store any personal or financial data on external servers**.

All data entered into the app is processed and stored locally on your device only.

### Data Stored Locally

* **Financial Data**: Income, expenses, budgets, subscriptions, loans, goals, and related records.
* **App Preferences**: Theme selection, currency preference, and UI settings.
* **Security Data**: Encrypted PIN and recovery key stored using platform-secure storage (Android Keystore / iOS Keychain).

TrueCash does not require user accounts and does not associate data with any identity.

---

## 2. No Data Sharing or Tracking

TrueCash does **not**:

* Use analytics or telemetry services
* Use advertising SDKs
* Track user behavior
* Share data with third parties
* Transmit data over the network

There are **no trackers, cookies, or background network calls**.

---

## 3. Data Security

### Local Encryption

On supported platforms, local databases are encrypted using **SQLCipher (AES-256)**.
Encryption keys are managed by the operating system’s secure key storage.

### App Lock (PIN & Biometrics)

* Optional PIN protection is stored securely using system-level secure storage.
* Optional biometric authentication uses device APIs only.
* A recovery key is generated when PIN protection is enabled.

If both the PIN and recovery key are lost, **data cannot be recovered**. TrueCash has no backdoor access.

---

## 4. Permissions

TrueCash requests permissions **only when required for user-initiated features**:

* **Notifications**: Bill reminders and alerts (optional).
* **Storage / Files**: Only when exporting or backing up data at the user’s request.
* **Biometrics**: Optional device-level authentication for unlocking the app.

Permissions are never accessed in the background.

---

## 5. Data Deletion

You can delete all app data at any time by using the **Reset Application** option within the app.

Uninstalling the app also permanently removes all locally stored data from your device.

---

## 6. Desktop Platforms

On desktop platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), all data is stored locally on the user’s device using the operating system’s file system.
No data is transmitted externally.

---

## 7. Contact and Transparency

TrueCash is an open-source application.
For privacy-related questions or concerns, issues can be raised via the project’s GitHub repository.
