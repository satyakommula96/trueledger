# Transactions & Entries

TrueLedger categorizes financial data into several distinct types to ensure accurate reporting and net worth calculation.

## 📥 Entry Types

### 1. Variable Expenses
Daily spending such as groceries, fuel, or entertainment. These are the primary entries that count toward your **Daily Streak**.

### 2. Income
Primary salary, rental income, or dividends. Recording income allows TrueLedger to calculate your savings rate.

### 3. Fixed Expenses
Recurring monthly bills like rent or gym memberships. These are kept separate from variable spending to help you understand your "baseline" cost of living.

### 4. Investments (Assets)
Stocks, mutual funds, or gold. These contribute positively to your **Net Worth**.

### 5. Liabilities (Debt)
- **Loans**: Track EMIs, interest rates, and remaining balances. Automatically resolves real bank brand SVGs based on provider name.
- **Credit Cards**: Track statement balances, minimum dues, and due dates. Renders dynamic brand logos (Chase, N26, Visa, etc.) based on card or bank name.

## 📝 Adding Data
- Tap the **+** button or the specific "Add" buttons on the dashboard.
- Input the amount, select a category, and specify the date.
- Notes and tags can be added for better searchability later.
